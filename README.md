# Fashion-MNIST
### Multiclass Classification for Fashion MNIST using Deep Learning

## Description
This is a multiclass classification project by Team AISH on the Fashion MNIST dataset using various deep learning techniques.

Team members:
* Abhilash Kasarla
* Harish Prasanth
* Inderjot Singh
* Saideep Reddy
* Vaishali Rajendren

## Requirements

* Download the models and data from this [link](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1Uhylt7lgs7FcvrboW2dG-8dP4FKlVEyj)
* Requires GPU to run all codes


## Code Organization

There are different architectures that we used to compare the performance across all of them.
You can view the results in the Jupyter notebooks inside folder architectures/ 


Configurations to run all the models can be found inside config.py
